#1 I first use the same name email.py which is in conflict with the file
#in python lib.
#in addition, have to enable two step verification to set up a app password for
#login

#strip() strips away whitespaces, but space is not counted as whitespace,
#only tab or multiple space is counted as whitespace.


#skills: use try except, let you specify what to use once exception happens, for users,
# except content makes much more sense.
